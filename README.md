I'm a Physicist. My degree thesis was about quantum chemistry to desing derivates of aminoglycosides, searching for the stable configurations and characterize it's properties as function of a bonding angle.

I'm currently working on my PhD project about Machine Learning to identify pattrons in proteins that are _very_ similar to each other. There is a very close relationship between the function and the structures of proteins. I hope that changes in structure will allow me to predict changes in functions.

I'm currently learning Machine Learning, Quantum Computing and Data Analysis to become an expert as my project needs it. Also, I'm continue studing Quantum Chemistry in my free time, because I love physics and I don't want to go so far beyond that field. I'll be updating my README repository as I understand more about GitHub.

Ask me about physics and chemical structures, that's my speciality.

Fun fact: I love playing Pathfinder, as GM and player.
